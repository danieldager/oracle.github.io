# Random Sequence Prediction with LSTM Models

## Project Overview

This project, conducted in conjunction with the Laboratoire de Systèmes Perceptifs at École Normale Supérieure, aims to predict binary sequences generated by human subjects. These sequences incorporate additional biometric signals such as the delay between presses and pupil diameter. We employ two different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to solve this prediction problem:

1. **LSTM_Vary**: Processes sequences of varying lengths by using all incremental segments of each sequence.
2. **LSTM_Fixed**: Processes sequences of a fixed length by using discrete overlapping chunks.

The primary question we seek to answer is how well these models can predict the next element in a binary sequence, given the sequence's past elements and associated biometric data.
